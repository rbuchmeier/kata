# Reverse Roman Numeral (1st attempt, chose unary solution)

## Time

Took less than 5 minutes to complete.

## Quality

- Not the absolutely most readable solution, but very concise and not too hard to figure out.
- Unary solutions are a little hard to grasp at first if you are expecting a number-based solution.

## Next Steps

Next we should do a number-based solution (this one isn't going to get much simpler).
