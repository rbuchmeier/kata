# Ray Tracing

Image Output - Attempt #1 (image version of Hello World)

## Time

Took about an hour to complete. Most of this time was spent understanding what a PPM file format looks like.

## Quality

- No tests
- The progressbar is broken out decently, but poorly named
- The code is in one giant block
- But, it outputs an image in a ppm format

## Next Steps

If we decide to do this same chapter again, breaking down the code, better naming, and adding tests would be a win.
