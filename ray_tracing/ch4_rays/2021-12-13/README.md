# Chapter 4 - Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background

## Time

This took about an hour, mostly because I was trying to figure out how to what in his examples I could do using functional programming, which was almost nothing and ended up just creating a simple gradient.

## Quality

- It seems readable
- There are no tests
- I chose to forgoe the for loop over WIDTH since we are doing a top down gradient and it is so much faster this way (obviously)
- The use of global variables is probably not ideal but, works just fine for this example and it's easy to change

## Next Steps

Move on to the next chapter, I don't think we can code up his work without getting to some more meaty stuff.
