# RBuchmeier Kata

Disclaimer: there is a lot of discussion around the pros and cons of code kata. I won't get into an argument about whether or not "code kata" is valuable. There are a lot of different ideas about what code kata is supposed to look like, I don't want to get into that either. Read below if you want to read what purpose this repo serves me.

# High Level Purpose
The purpose of *this* kata repo is to provide a place for me to hone my skills by coming up with different, good, bad, creative, and indifferent solutions to common questions/project. Also, this serves as a good way to spend a small amount of time daily to upkeep up my code skills when I am not doing much code in my day job.

## Outcomes
I am hoping for some specific outcomes from practicing this project.
- Fluency with my IDE.
- Fluency in basic tools/libraries that I don't use every day (for example I don't often parse csv files, and when I do I just google the solution. It would be nice not to have to look up all those strange little things).
- Fluency with different algorithms/techniques so I spend less time coming up with the simplest solution for the problem at hand.

## For you

Feel free to take any inspiration from this that you want.
