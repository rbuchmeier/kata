# Roman Numerals

## Time

Took just under 10 minutes to complete

## Quality

- The data structure (`ORDER_OF_REPLACEMENT`) is rather unreadable, but the rest of the code is very concise and readable
- At first glance the time complexity seems good, but I don't know enough about the time complexity of `.replace()` to be sure
- Find a solution without it being a numbers game was enjoyable.

## Next Steps

I am curious what other ways there are to solve this problem. Re-doing yesterdays solution in a less explicit way is the last idea I really want to try while on roman numerals. After that, I should start coming up with standards for how to test the different solutions and compare them.
