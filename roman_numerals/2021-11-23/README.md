# The Goal

Create a converter that will take an integer and return the Roman Numeral equivalent.

# The Results

## The Time to Complete

This took about 20 minutes today, substantially less than previous attempts.

## Quality

- The best thing about this iteration was using tuples instead of a dictionary. My time interviewing definitely gave me a preference for dictionaries over tuples due to time complexity.
- The code in this is substantially cleaner due to taking advantage of the pairing inherent to tuples.
- I chose to hard code 4s and 9s instead of generating them dynamically because in past iterations they seemed to add unnecessary complexity.

# Future Improvements

- Attempt to solve in constant time complexity instead of linear
- Attempt to solve functionally.
