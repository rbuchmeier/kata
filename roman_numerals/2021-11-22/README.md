# The Goal

Convert integer to roman numeral

# The Result

## The Time

Took about 45 minutes

## Quality

- Better Testing than 11/15
- I like having 9s and 4s be generated programmatically...however, this did result in nearly a dozen more lines of code (~1/3 of the program). While it is better practice and more scalable, in a real life situation I would likely write out the 4s and 9s manually.
- This is probably the least readable iteration of the program. Future iterations should focus on composable functions or an object of sorts...(could be interesting to write this functionally)
