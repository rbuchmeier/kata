# Index and Templates

## Time

This took ~10 minutes.

## Quality

- The biggest oddity here is the random 2 emptry strings at the end of the Roman Numeral list...but it was a much simpler solution than figuring out other ways to stop index errors when generating roman numerals for the thousands place.
- The most complex pieces of the code are converting the number to a list of templates and replacing characters.
- Overall, this is pretty concise, and decently readable.

## Next Steps

I think it's about time to start defining the various techniques to create this solution.
