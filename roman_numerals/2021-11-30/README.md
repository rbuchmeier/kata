# Roman Numerals

## The Results

### Time

This solution took me about 2.5 hours to complete.

### Quality

- What an interesting solution. The code ended up being a bit shorter than I first expected
- It is very dense and on the slightly unreadable side.
- This is a substantially different way to handle 4s and 9s.
- The use of recursion feels helpful.
- This feels like a multidimensional array in a way (roman * base_indexes * magnitude)

### Next steps

Refine! There is some good possibility here that can be more concise and hopefully more efficient as well.

### Notes

I would like to thank sensei StackOverflow for the help finding a more creative solution to this. I found the code golf answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28777219/basic-program-to-convert-integer-to-roman-numerals

In that answer by d5ous, once I saw the "magic numbers" I understood a new way to handle 4s/9s. There are probably additional tidbits in that answer and/or other answers that may help to further consolidate/clean my code. I want to refine this for myself before going back to SO in search of more ideas/solutions.
