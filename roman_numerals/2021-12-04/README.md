# Roman Numerals

## Time

Very fast, took about 10 minutes while distracted.

## Quality

- Very concise. I had considered using `.reverse()` instead of `[::-1]` for readability, but I decided to cut out the extra line (since `.reverse()` is a non-returning method).
- The extra work at the beginning is questionable, but it seems a worthwhile exercise. And in today's day and age it does not feel like a hardship with some minimal regex.

## Next Steps

- Try this with generating the larger roman numerals (10s place and larger) instead of hardcoding it.
- Try the Unary method (see previous kata).
