# Roman Numerals

## The Goal

Convert an integer to a roman numeral.

## The Result

### Time

I relied pretty heavily on vs code this time, took about 10 minutes.

### Quality

- This is probably a good implementation without a more advanced algorithm.
- The 4s and 9s are still not ideal...
- Still, pretty decent answer without finding a better algorithm for the 4s/9s.
